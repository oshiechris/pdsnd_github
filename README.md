>Data: US Bikeshare Data (https://www.motivateco.com/use-our-data/)

Story: Comparing the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. What kinds of information would we want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If we were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how we would want to use the service?

Investigation: Any differences within each system by those users that are registered, regular users VS short-term, casual users? It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes.

(Any other relationships? Where do bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? Weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership? How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?)
